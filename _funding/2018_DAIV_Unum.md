Funding: Â£2086.00 <br/>

This DIAVs has been done in association with Institute for Analytics and Data Science for Unum Group. A Data
Analytics Innovation Voucher funded by the Economics and Social Science Council (ESRC) Business
and Local Government Data Research Centre (BLGDRC) supported the project.

The aim of the study is to identify the data that could potentially be used to identify possible new
clients (as in a new HR Director being hired by a non-client company) or even an opportunity to offer
a more enhanced product to an existing client. The objectives are given as follows:

* Given the `Company Name` and their `Postcode`, identify the higher management team such
as `HR director`, `Operations Manager HR`, and `Vice President HR`.

* We have developed a smart tool using web scraping and NLP to extract the relevant information from the web.
