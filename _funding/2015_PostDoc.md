Project title: "A BCI Operated Hand Exoskeleton based Neuro-rehabilitation
System for Movement Restoration in Paralysis" <br/>
Funder: DST - UKIERI <br/>
Role: Post-Doc (7-months) <br/>
Supervisors: Professor Girijesh Prasad (UK) and Professor Ashish Dutta <br/>



Project Objectives
======
It is known that stroke sufferers can gain much enhanced upper limb movement recovery with active physical practice in conjunction with motor imagery (MI) practice of activities of daily living. To this end, project objectives are to:

* Develop a lightweight three-finger exoskeleton with embedded sensors, capable of replicating human motion
for physical practice. It will be controlled by usersâ€™ EMG and EEG signals in assist-as-needed mode.

* Develop a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) that facilitates EMG and EEG for controlling the exoskeleton and provides visual neurofeedback to ensure focused physical and MI practices.

* Conduct pilot trials to evaluate the effectiveness
