Funding: Â£2086.00 <br/>

This DIAVs has been done in association with Institute for Analytics and Data Science for Unum Group. A Data
Analytics Innovation Voucher funded by the Economics and Social Science Council (ESRC) Business
and Local Government Data Research Centre (BLGDRC) supported the project.

The aim is to bring together information regarding complaints, inspections and enforcement actions
relating to businesses across Essex. The purpose is to enable intelligence gathering and information
using new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, web-scarping, and natural
language processing. The scraped and processed information may help in shared understanding of
`businesses of concern`, help organisations understand those that are currently under their radar, and
have a wider understanding of the tools available across services to address concerns.

The objectives are given as follows:

* Given the minimal amount of keywords such as `Area` and their `Postcode`, identify the online
listed properties with their details `Address`, `Post-Code`, `Propoerty type`, `url`, `number
of bedrooms` and `Price`.

* The searching procedure requires the smart approach to identify a relevant information in the
data or preparing a database, where data mining may help to answer various questions.

* The tool that need to be developed can either use Python or R.
