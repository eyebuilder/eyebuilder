excerpt: 'In this study, we have introduced a new corticomuscular feature extraction method based on the correlation between band-limited power time-courses (CBPT) associated with EEG and EMG. 16 healthy individuals and 8 hemiplegic patients participated in a BCI-based hand orthosis triggering task, to test the performance of the CBPT method. The healthy population was equally divided into two groups; one experimental group for CBPT-based BCI experiment and another control group for EEG-EMG coherence based BCI experiment.'
