This talk was focused on Brain-Computer interfaceing. Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a collaboration between a brain and a device that enables signals from the brain to direct some external activity, such as control of a cursor or a prosthetic limb. The interface enables a direct communications pathway between the brain and the object to be controlled. I have discussed my research done during my PhD and Post-Doc.
