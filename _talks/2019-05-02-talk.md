In this talk, I have covered the topics given as follows:

* EEG/MEG-based BCI
* Non-Stationarity in EEG/MEG signals; specially covariate shift
* Covariate shift detection and adaptation
* Covariate shift adaptation in BCI-based Neuro-rehabilitation
* Deep learning for covariate shift adaptation using Generative models
