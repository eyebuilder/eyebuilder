The Data Science Intensive (DSI) program is an 8-week hands-on skills training 
data science course based on solving real-world problems. I have spent two week to deliver first session of this DSI program. I have focused to present on the following topics and we competed on a Kaggle dataset: Advance House Price Prediction

* Advanced python skills
* Managing the data science project life cycle
* Problem solving and model selection: starting to build a solution
* Machine learning algorithms: which one is right?
